## Overview

This is an Unreal Engine plugin that provides a vectorscope, a histogram and a waveform, tools which are available by default in lots of other production software. 

All those tools could prove useful in the production pipeline, helping artists get objective insights into the colorization of a scene, without having to exit UE.

The plugin is now available on FAB, and it is free for personal use. You can find it [here](https://www.fab.com/listings/17c424fc-9f14-42dd-9f31-e5accaeb4862).
